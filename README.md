# TrilinkTree
Final project for Data Structures

This program will accept integers and add them to a Tri-link tree, sort them, 
and display them as they are added. It will also allow you to search and delete integers
from the tree. 

Props to GB for helping me figure out a lot of places I messed up and broke my code.
